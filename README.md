# Word Game

**Word Game** is a Java-based desktop application that helps users (especially teachers) create custom word lists and randomly select words through a simple graphical interface. It was originally developed for a geography teacher to list place names (like rivers) and pick one at random for class activities. The game is easy to use and requires no programming knowledge â€“ just start it up, input your words, and let the program do the rest.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project provides a friendly **graphical user interface (GUI)** for creating and managing word lists grouped by categories. You can think of each category as a topic (e.g., *Rivers*, *Mountains*, *Cities*), and under each category, you maintain a list of words.

The main purpose is to randomly draw a word from a chosen category with a single click â€“ great for quizzes, classroom games, or vocabulary practice.
